## The Challenge

Traditional forest inventory methods are time-consuming and often limited in scale. This exploration examines how machine learning techniques can complement these approaches to improve accuracy and efficiency.

## Approach

This project utilized public forestry datasets to develop and test machine learning models that can predict forest attributes from limited sample data.

## Implementation

Using Python and scikit-learn, I implemented several regression models to predict forest metrics:

```python
# Sample code snippet
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Prepare data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    features, targets, test_size=0.25, random_state=42)

# Train model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

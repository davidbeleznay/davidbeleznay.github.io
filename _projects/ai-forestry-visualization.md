## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use Claude to analyze and visualize forestry data. By leveraging Claude's capabilities, we can extract insights from complex datasets that might be difficult to identify through traditional analysis methods.

## Approach

1. **Data Collection**: Public forestry data from BC government sources
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and organizing datasets for analysis
3. **Prompt Engineering**: Creating effective prompts for Claude to analyze the data
4. **Visualization**: Using Claude's outputs to create meaningful visualizations

## Key Findings

- AI analysis identified several correlations between tree growth patterns and local hydrology
- Visual representation of complex datasets improved communication of technical concepts
- Multi-variable analysis revealed seasonal patterns not obvious in traditional reports

## Future Directions

This approach shows promise for analyzing additional forestry datasets. Next steps include:

- Expanding the analysis to include climate change impact data
- Creating interactive visualizations for educational purposes
- Integrating multiple data sources for comprehensive ecosystem modeling

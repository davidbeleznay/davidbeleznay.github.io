# Emergency Jekyll Fix

## The Problem
The site was not loading because:
1. A `.nojekyll` file was preventing Jekyll from processing the site
2. An empty `index.html` file was conflicting with `index.md`

## The Solution
1. Remove the `.nojekyll` file to enable Jekyll processing
2. Remove the empty `index.html` file
3. Force GitHub Pages to rebuild the site

## Files to Remove Manually
- `.nojekyll` (prevents Jekyll from running)
- `index.html` (empty file causing conflicts)

Jekyll should now properly process `index.md` as the homepage.

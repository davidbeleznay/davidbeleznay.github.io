## About AI Forester

AI Forester represents my professional exploration at the intersection of forestry expertise and artificial intelligence capabilities.

### My Background

With extensive experience in forestry and environmental engineering, I've developed a deep understanding of forest ecosystems, hydrology, and terrain analysis. Now, I'm leveraging that knowledge to explore how AI can address complex environmental challenges.

### The AI Forester Approach

This journey focuses on:

- Practical applications of AI in forestry and environmental contexts
- Sharing insights and lessons learned along the way
- Building bridges between traditional forestry expertise and emerging AI capabilities
- Creating resources for professionals in both domains

### Professional Focus

My work maintains clear boundaries with my primary employment, focusing exclusively on public data and generalized approaches that benefit the broader professional community.

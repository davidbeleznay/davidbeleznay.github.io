## Changes Made

I've made the following updates to your AI Forester website repository:

1. **Added SVG placeholder images**:
   - `assets/images/projects/beaver-dam-ai.svg` - Beaver and AI Restoration project

   - `assets/images/projects/prompt-engineering.svg` - Prompt Engineering for Forestry

2. **Created SVG to JPG Conversion Tools**:
   - Added JavaScript converter: `scripts/svg-to-jpg-converter.js`
   - Created browser interface: `tools/svg-to-jpg.html`

3. **Added Documentation**:
   - Updated project images README: `assets/images/projects/README.md`
   - Created this summary file

## Next Steps for You

### 1. Convert SVG Files to JPG

You'll need to convert the SVG placeholder images to JPG format for proper display on your website. You have two options:

#### Option A: Browser-Based Conversion
1. Open `https://davidbeleznay.github.io/tools/svg-to-jpg.html` in your browser
2. Drag and drop the SVG files onto the converter
3. The JPG files will be downloaded automatically
4. Move these files to the `assets/images/projects/` directory

#### Option B: Command-Line Conversion (if you have Node.js)
1. Clone your repository locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/davidbeleznay/davidbeleznay.github.io.git
   cd davidbeleznay.github.io
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install sharp fs path
   ```

3. Run the conversion script:
   ```bash
   node scripts/svg-to-jpg-converter.js assets/images/projects assets/images/projects
   ```

4. Commit and push the new JPG files:
   ```bash
   git add assets/images/projects/*.jpg
   git commit -m "Add converted JPG images for projects"
   git push
   ```

### 2. Verify Your Website

After converting and uploading the JPG files, visit your website to verify that the images are displaying correctly:

### 3. Future Improvements

The SVG placeholder images I've created are functional but basic. When you have time, you should:

1. Replace them with actual project photographs
2. Create more detailed custom graphics that better represent each project
3. Add more projects to showcase your AI Forester brand
4. Consider optimizing all images for better performance

## Technical Notes

- The SVG files are vector-based and resolution-independent
- The JPG files should be sized at 1200Ã—800 pixels (as set in the converter)
- All images use the AI Forester brand color scheme
- The conversion tools work entirely in the browser - no files are uploaded to any server
- The SVG files will remain in the repository as a backup

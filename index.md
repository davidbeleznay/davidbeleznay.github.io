      <h2>About AI Forester</h2>
      <p>AI Forester was created to explore the emerging intersection between traditional forestry expertise and cutting-edge artificial intelligence capabilities.</p>
      <p>As a professional forester and engineer with experience in hydrology and terrain analysis, I've witnessed firsthand how AI tools can enhance our understanding and management of forest ecosystems.</p>
      <p>Through this platform, I share projects, insights, and resources that demonstrate the practical applications of AI in forestry contexts, while building a bridge between these two specialized domains.</p>

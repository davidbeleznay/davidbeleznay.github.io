## Image Guidelines

For optimal website performance:

- Use JPG format for photographs
- Use PNG format for graphics with transparency needs (like your signature)
- Optimize image file sizes (aim for under 200KB per image)
- Use descriptive, consistent file naming
- Maintain recommended aspect ratios
- Ensure images are high quality but web-optimized

## Placeholder Images

Until you have your own images ready, consider using stock photographs of:

1. Beaver dams and wetlands
2. Forest streams and waterways
3. Data visualizations and AI interfaces
4. Professional headshots in outdoor/forestry settings

These images will help your site maintain its professional appearance while you prepare your own custom photography.

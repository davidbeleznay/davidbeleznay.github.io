This is a placeholder for a climate-smart forestry cover/hero image.

For this image, I recommend:
- A panoramic view of a well-managed forest with diverse tree species
- Visual data elements showing carbon sequestration metrics
- Climate monitoring stations visible within the forest
- Seasonal transition elements showing forest resilience
- Digital overlay showing AI analysis of forest health
- Consider a split view showing forest adaptation over time

Please replace this placeholder with your actual cover photo.

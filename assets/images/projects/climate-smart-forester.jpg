This is a placeholder for your personal photo showing you in a climate-smart forestry context. 

For this image, I recommend:
- A professional shot of yourself in a forest setting
- Perhaps showing you with climate monitoring equipment
- Or reviewing forest data on a tablet/device
- Consider including trees marked for carbon analysis
- Alternatively, you near a weather station in a managed forest

Please replace this placeholder with your actual photo.

# Site Status Report - Emergency Diagnosis

## Current Issue: Homepage Not Loading (Blank Screen)

**Date:** June 4, 2025  
**Status:** Investigating DNS/GitHub Pages Configuration

## What We've Confirmed
✅ **GitHub Pages is working** - `/services.html` loads correctly  
✅ **Domain is configured** - CNAME file exists pointing to aiforester.com  
✅ **Repository structure is correct** - Jekyll files are properly organized  
✅ **Homepage file exists** - `index.html` has been created with content  

## What's Not Working
❌ **Homepage (index.html) returns blank page** at aiforester.com  
❌ **DNS or GitHub Pages deployment issue** preventing index.html from serving

## Likely Causes

### 1. DNS Propagation Issue
- DNS changes can take 24-48 hours to fully propagate
- GitHub Pages may not be recognizing the domain configuration

### 2. GitHub Pages Deployment Problem
- The `.nojekyll` file may still be causing issues
- GitHub Actions workflow may be stuck or failing

### 3. Domain Configuration Issue
- DNS records may need verification
- HTTPS certificate generation may be pending

## Immediate Next Steps Needed

### Check DNS Configuration
```bash
dig aiforester.com +noall +answer -t A
dig www.aiforester.com +noall +answer -t CNAME
```
Should show GitHub Pages IP addresses (185.199.108-111.153)

### Verify GitHub Pages Settings
1. Go to Repository Settings → Pages
2. Confirm custom domain shows "aiforester.com"
3. Check if "Enforce HTTPS" is available (indicates DNS success)
4. Look for any error messages

### Force GitHub Pages Rebuild
If DNS is correct, try:
1. Remove custom domain setting
2. Wait 5 minutes
3. Re-add custom domain setting
4. Wait for DNS check to complete

# Climate-Smart Forestry: AI's Role in Adaptation and Mitigation

As a forester with over two decades of experience, I've witnessed the growing impacts of climate change on our forest ecosystems. The challenges are immense, but so are the opportunities—particularly at the intersection of forestry expertise and artificial intelligence. Climate-smart forestry represents a holistic approach that focuses on both adaptation (building resilience) and mitigation (enhancing carbon sequestration) in our working forests.

## Why Climate-Smart Forestry Matters

Forests are not passive victims of climate change; they're active participants in climate solutions. When managed thoughtfully, they can:

- Sequester significant quantities of carbon
- Provide clean water and wildlife habitat
- Support local economies through sustainable timber
- Build resilience against extreme weather, pests, and diseases

However, the complex interplay of factors affecting forest health and carbon dynamics has traditionally been difficult to model and monitor at scale. This is where AI comes in.

## Four Key AI Applications in Climate-Smart Forestry

### 1. Advanced Carbon Monitoring

Traditional forest inventory methods provide good snapshots but can be expensive and time-consuming to update regularly. AI systems now allow us to:

- Process satellite imagery and LiDAR data to track forest carbon stocks in near real-time
- Identify trends and anomalies that might indicate changes in forest health
- Create more accurate, spatially explicit models of carbon sequestration across landscapes

I've helped develop monitoring networks with dozens of satellite-linked weather stations providing continuous data—but the challenge has always been efficiently analyzing this wealth of information. AI makes this possible.

### 2. Natural Asset Valuation

A forest's value goes far beyond timber. The ecosystem services forests provide—carbon sequestration, water filtration, habitat provision—are increasingly recognized but historically difficult to quantify. AI helps us:

- Calculate the value of multiple ecosystem services simultaneously
- Model how these values change under different management scenarios
- Develop more compelling business cases for conservation and improved management

When we can express natural capital values clearly, we open new revenue streams for forest owners and managers—helping secure the long-term economic viability of working forests.

### 3. Adaptation Modeling and Planning

The climate our forests experience today is not the climate they'll face tomorrow. AI helps us prepare by:

- Integrating climate projections with site-specific data to identify vulnerable stands
- Suggesting species and genetic varieties likely to thrive under future conditions
- Optimizing forest structure for resilience against extreme weather events

This proactive approach is essential for forest management that works on 60-100 year rotations—decisions made today will determine forest health decades from now.

### 4. Communication and Visualization

Perhaps one of the most underappreciated applications of AI is in communication. Climate data and forestry concepts can be complex, but AI-driven visualization tools help us:

- Create compelling visual narratives about carbon sequestration potential
- Translate technical data into accessible formats for diverse stakeholders
- Build support for climate-smart forestry practices by clearly demonstrating benefits

## My Journey in Climate-Smart Forestry

In 2023, I was honored to receive the Forest Professionals BC's Climate Change Innovator Award for my work developing practical climate solutions in forestry. This included:

- Leading a network of 36 satellite-linked weather stations
- Developing the framework for the BigCoast Forest Climate Initiative
- Creating workable climate adaptation strategies for operational forestry

What I've learned is that the most effective solutions integrate technical innovations with practical field experience. AI tools are tremendously powerful, but they must be designed and applied with a deep understanding of forest ecosystems and operational realities.

## Looking Forward: The AI-Enabled Future of Forestry

As AI capabilities continue to advance, I see tremendous potential to scale climate-smart forestry practices. This includes:

- More accessible tools for small woodland owners to quantify carbon benefits
- Better integration of climate considerations into day-to-day forest management
- Increased investment in natural climate solutions as carbon markets mature
- More compelling communication about the role of working forests in climate action

Working at this intersection of forestry and technology requires both technical expertise and practical experience—translating cutting-edge AI capabilities into solutions that work in the field. This is exactly the space where I focus my work.

## Join the Climate-Smart Forestry Journey

Whether you're a forest owner, a forestry professional, or an AI specialist interested in environmental applications, there's a role for you in advancing climate-smart forestry. I'd love to connect and explore how AI can support your specific forestry and climate goals.

The forests we manage today will shape our climate future—let's ensure they're as resilient and effective as possible.

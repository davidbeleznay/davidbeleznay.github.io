# Welcome to AI Forester

After two decades in the woods as a professional forester and engineer, I've witnessed firsthand the challenges and opportunities facing our forest ecosystems. From climate change adaptation to sustainable resource management, the forestry sector is at a critical intersection of traditional knowledge and technological innovation.

## Why AI Forester Exists

AI Forester was born from a simple observation: the same AI tools revolutionizing other industries could transform how we understand, manage, and interact with forest ecosystems. As someone with deep roots in practical forestry and a growing expertise in AI applications, I created this platform to:

1. **Bridge specialized domains** - Connect forestry professionals with AI capabilities in practical, accessible ways
2. **Solve real problems** - Focus on actual challenges facing foresters, not theoretical applications
3. **Share knowledge openly** - Document discoveries and techniques that others can build upon
4. **Build community** - Create connection points between forestry experts and AI specialists

## What You'll Find Here

AI Forester is organized around three core areas:

### 1. Projects
Practical applications showing AI tools in action for forestry contextsâ€”from beaver-assisted restoration enhanced by AI to specialized visualization tools for complex forestry datasets.

### 2. Products
Tools and frameworks I've developed to solve specific forestry challenges, from the comprehensive Forestry 5.0 system to the field-ready Digital Fieldbook.

### 3. Learning Resources
Guides, tutorials and insights to help you apply AI techniques to your own forestry work, regardless of your technical background.

## The Forest Flows Newsletter

Beyond this website, I write regularly about the intersection of forestry and technology in my newsletter [Forest Flows](https://forestflows.substack.com). There, I explore climate-smart forestry concepts, share practical AI applications, and build connections between timber production, carbon management, and cutting-edge research.

## Looking Ahead

This blog will feature:

- **Case studies** of AI applications in forest management
- **Tutorials** for implementing AI tools in forestry workflows
- **Interviews** with innovators working at this intersection
- **Reviews** of relevant technologies and their practical applications
- **Thought pieces** on where this field is heading

## Join the Journey
